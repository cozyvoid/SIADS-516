    > The rate at which data is being generated
    - the rate at which data can be uploaded/downloaded
    - The processing speed contraints of the hardware handling the data
    - Data describing either locational movement or otherwise tracking changes

3. True or False: A "combining stage" working with data would correspond with the Map stage of MapReduce.

    - True
    > False

4. True or False: There must always be a reduction step in MapReduce

    - True
    > False
