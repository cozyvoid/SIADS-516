Understanding the Problem
The goal is to process a large text file and identify the top 10 words with the highest syllable counts. This involves:
    1. Reading and parsing the text.
    2. Counting syllables for each word.
    3. Sorting the words by their syllable counts.
    4. Returning the top 10 results.

Steps to Solve the Problem
1. Setting Up the Environment:
    - Use the mrjob library for the MapReduce job.
    - Import necessary libraries: re for regex, syllables for counting syllables, and sys for error logging.
2. Splitting the Text:
    - Define a splitter function to break the text into individual words using regex.
3. Filtering Words:
    - Create a set of STOPWORDS to filter out common words that should be excluded from analysis.
4. Mapping Words to Syllable Counts:
    - Implement a mapper_get_words function to:
        - Split lines into words.
        - Convert words to lowercase.
        - Filter out stopwords and non-alphabetic words.
        - Estimate syllable counts for remaining words.
        - Yield (syllable_count, word) pairs.
5. Reducing and Sorting Results:
    - Define a reducer_find_top_ten function to:
        - Collect and deduplicate the (syllable_count, word) pairs.
        - Sort the results by syllable count (descending) and then alphabetically.
        - Yield the top 10 words.
6. Execution:
    - Set up the MRMostSyllables class with the necessary steps (mapper and reducer).
    - Use the run() method to execute the MapReduce job.

Key Considerations
1. Efficiency:
    - Ensure the map and reduce functions are efficient and handle large datasets gracefully.
2. Accuracy:
    - Use the syllables.estimate function correctly to get accurate syllable counts.
    - Filter out non-alphabetic and stop words to focus on meaningful words.
3. Sorting and Duplicates:
    - Use a set to remove duplicate words in the reducer.
    - Sort the results by syllable count and alphabetically to get the top 10 words.
4. Testing and Debugging:
    - Test the script on a small file to verify correctness.
    - Use debug prints to troubleshoot any issues with word splitting, filtering, or syllable counting.
