    "MapReduce is a programming model for performing parallel processing on large datasets. Although it is a powerful technique, its basics are relatively simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a collection of items we’d like to process somehow. For instance, the items might be website logs, the texts of various books, image files, or anything else. A basic version of the MapReduce algorithm consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Use a `mapper` function to turn each item into zero or more key/value pairs. (Often this is called the `map` function, but there is already a Python function called `map` and we don’t need to confuse the two.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Collect together all the pairs with identical keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Use a `reducer` function on each collection of grouped values to produce output values for the corresponding key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**\n",
    "MapReduce is sort of passé, so much so that I considered removing this chapter from the second edition. But I decided it’s still an interesting topic, so I ended up leaving it in (obviously).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all sort of abstract, so let’s look at a specific example. There are few absolute rules of data science, but one of them is that your first MapReduce example has to involve counting words."

    "**Why MapReduce?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the primary benefit of MapReduce is that it allows us to distribute computations by moving the processing to the data. Imagine we want to word-count across billions of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our original (non-MapReduce) approach requires the machine doing the processing to have access to every document. This means that the documents all need to either live on that machine or else be transferred to it during processing. More important, it means that the machine can process only one document at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**\n",
    "Possibly it can process up to a few at a time if it has multiple cores and if the code is rewritten to take advantage of them. But even so, all the documents still have to get to that machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine now that our billions of documents are scattered across 100 machines. With the right infrastructure (and glossing over some of the details), we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Have each machine run the mapper on its documents, producing lots of key/value pairs.\n",
    "    - Distribute those key/value pairs to a number of “reducing” machines, making sure that the pairs corresponding to any given key all end up on the same machine.\n",
    "    - Have each reducing machine group the pairs by key and then run the reducer on each set of values.\n",
    "    - Return each (key, output) pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is amazing about this is that it scales horizontally. If we double the number of machines, then (ignoring certain fixed costs of running a MapReduce system) our computation should run approximately twice as fast. Each mapper machine will only need to do half as much work, and (assuming there are enough distinct keys to further distribute the reducer work) the same is true for the reducer machines."

    "One thing you have probably noticed is that many of our mappers seem to include a bunch of extra information. For example, when counting words, rather than emitting `(word, 1)` and summing over the values, we could have emitted `(word, None)` and just taken the length.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason we didn’t do this is that, in the distributed setting, we sometimes want to use combiners to reduce the amount of data that has to be transferred around from machine to machine. If one of our mapper machines sees the word data 500 times, we can tell it to combine the 500 instances of `(\"data\", 1)` into a single `(\"data\", 500)` before handing off to the reducing machine. This results in a lot less data getting moved around, which can make our algorithm substantially faster still.\n",
