### Solutions with Explanations:

---

**1. True or False: Spark requires Hadoop**  
**Answer: False**  
**Explanation:**  
Spark does not require Hadoop to operate. While Spark can run on Hadoop's YARN cluster manager and utilize Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage, it is a standalone system that can function independently.

---

**2. Which of the following do driver programs use to access Spark?**  
**Answer: A SparkSession Object**  
**Explanation:**  
Driver programs access Spark using a `SparkSession`, which is the entry point to using Spark's functionality in Spark 2.0 and later. It encapsulates all of Spark's core APIs, including DataFrame and Dataset APIs, making it simpler than `SparkContext` for most applications.

**3. Which of the following is NOT true of a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)?**  
**Answer: RDDs are mutable collections of objects**  
**Explanation:**  
RDDs are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be modified. Instead, transformations create new RDDs. The immutability helps ensure consistency and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

---

**4. Which of the following RDD actions mentioned in Week 2 should you practice extra caution when using?**  
**Answer: Collect()**  
**Explanation:**  
The `collect()` action retrieves all elements of the RDD to the driver program, which can cause memory overflow if the RDD is large. Use it cautiously, especially when working with large datasets.

---

**5. True or False: When working with RDDs, using a transformation creates a new RDD**  
**Answer: True**  
**Explanation:**  
RDD transformations, such as `map()` or `filter()`, always produce a new RDD rather than modifying the existing one. This immutability is a core property of RDDs.

---

**6. Which of the following is true of Pair RDDs?**  
**Answer: Pair RDD's consist of key-value pairs where not all keys must be unique**  
**Explanation:**  
In Pair RDDs, keys are not required to be unique. This flexibility allows Pair RDDs to represent data more broadly, enabling operations like grouping or reducing by key.
