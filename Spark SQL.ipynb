    "## Review of Spark DataFrames\n",
    "- DataFrames are an essential component in Spark, organized into named columns, similar to tables in Pandas, R DataFrames, and Excel.\n",
    "- Key operations include:\n",
    "    - **Selecting Columns**: Use the `select` function to choose specific columns.\n",
    "    - **Filtering Data**: Apply conditions to filter rows, similar to showing rows where, for example, a \"stars\" column has values greater than or equal to four.\n",
    "    - **Displaying Results**: Use show for a human-readable format or `collect` for a list of rows suitable for further processing.\n",
    "    - **Grouping and Sorting**: Use `groupBy` for aggregation (e.g., counting) and sort results in a desired order."
